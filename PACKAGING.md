## Releases

### What is a release?

The [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is used for version numbering in this project.

A release is a [git tag](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) in the `main` branch of the project's git repositry that starts with the letter `v` followed by the Semantic Versioning based version number.

### Creating a new release

1. Update the version number in the [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) file.
2. Write what happend from fixes, changes and updates and every thing in this release in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.
3. Add a new `<release>` tag under the `<releases>` tag in the [`io.github.zefr0x.ianny.metainfo.xml`](io.github.zefr0x.ianny.metainfo.xml) file with information about the release and a link to the CHANGELOG file.
4. Create a git commit with all of those changes.
5. Create a signed git tag with a `v` letter followed by the version number e.g. for `v1.5.3` you should do `git tag -s v1.5.3`.
6. Push changes to the remote using `git push origin main --tags`
