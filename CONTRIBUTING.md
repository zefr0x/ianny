## Bug report

For now [GitHub Bug Traker](https://github.com/zefr0x/ianny/issues) is used for this project.

## Development

- The `stable` [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language is used mainly in this project.
- Dependencies management handled using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/).
- Building handled using [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)

### Style

- You should document every thing to keep the code easy for reading. Every file, every function, and any line that need a comment.

#### Setup `pre-commit`

To make every thing easy [**`pre-commit`**](https://pre-commit.com/) is used in this project, it should run in every commit, so you shouldn't commit any thing without checking it.

First install it:

```shell
pip install pre-commit
```

> It's better to use your OS's package manager to install it.

Then add it as a git hook while you are inside the repository:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

# Translation

We use `gettext` in this project, you have `.po` files to translate and a `.desktop` file.

## Files to Translate

- `po/<language_id>.po`
- `io.github.zefr0x.ianny.desktop`

## Adding New Language

1. Copy `po/io.github.zefr0x.ianny.pot` to `po/<language_id>.po`.
2. Add the language ID to the `po/LINGUAS` file (IDs are separated by space).
3. Start editing the `.po` file using any editor you want to use (e.g. [`Gtranslator`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gtranslator)).
