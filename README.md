[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/ianny.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/ianny/versions)

### Arch Linux

All packages are available on AUR, you can:

- build locally from latest stable release: [ianny](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ianny)
- build locally from latest Git commit: [ianny-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ianny-git)
- use the binary built by GitHub: [ianny-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ianny-bin)

### Download Binary From GitHub

For every new release a GitHub workflow will build a binary in GitHub servers and will upload it as a release asset in GitHub releases.

You can find the latest GitHub release [here](https://github.com/zefr0x/ianny/releases/latest) or the releases page [here](https://github.com/zefr0x/ianny/releases).

## Build

> [!Note]
> You need to have [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [`meson`](https://mesonbuild.com/) and [`libdbus-1-dev`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) installed in your system.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zefr0x/ianny.git

cd ianny

# Checkout to a release tag e.g. v1.0.1
git checkout vx.x.x

meson build
meson compile -C build
```

You will find the binary in `./build/src/ianny`

To install:

```shell
meson install -C build
```

# Usage

You just need to execute the binary eather directly or by enabling it to auto start with your desktop environment's settings, since it provides a `.desktop` file for auto-start.

# Config

The defaults might not fit your needs, so you can change them via a config file.

The config file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/io.github.zefr0x.ianny/config.toml` or by default `~/.config/io.github.zefr0x.ianny/config.toml`. Just create it and specify the options you need with the [toml format](https://toml.io/):

```toml
[timer]
# Timer will stop and reset when you are idle for this amount of seconds.
idle_timeout = 240
# Active duration that activates a break.
short_break_timeout = 1200
long_break_timeout = 3840
# Breaks duration.
short_break_duration = 120
long_break_duration = 240

[notification]
show_progress_bar = true
# Minimum delay of updating the progress bar (lower than 1s may return an error).
minimum_update_delay = 1
```

> [!Note]
> Time specified in seconds
